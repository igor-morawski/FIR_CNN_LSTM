# FIR_CNN-LSTM
CNN-LSTM model for exteremely low-resolution FIR sequences (draft)

This repo is for storing and structuring the project only.

- [x] build basic CNN-LSTM model 
- [ ] prepare samples (the model can't learn from samples cut this way yet)
- [ ] preprocess sequences
- [ ] add second modality (motion reperesentation)
